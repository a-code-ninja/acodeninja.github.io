And I think these posts might turn into a series! I was searching through soundcloud the other day and came across TheBluesMobile.com a blues show on soundcloud. The interview and bio/history of Hot Tuna brought me in, but then on came The California Honeydrops a blues / gospel / new orleans jazz band. I am now hooked and as soon as pay day comes around will be buying their new album Like you mean it.

Anyways on to the music itself, let me know what you think to this glorious album.
