It has been a while since I last put anything up here so I thought just sticking up a post with my latest listening experience might be the way to go. A while ago Wil Wheaton stuck a Zoe Keating track on This is my Jam called Tetrishead, fell in love with it while walking around the downs in Bristol (UK).

So today while at my day job I am listening to Zoe Keating’s Album “Into the Trees”. Give it a go! There is something special about looping a cello to create such a beautiful sound. Here is the album from Soundcloud

Hope people enjoy this as much as I have.
