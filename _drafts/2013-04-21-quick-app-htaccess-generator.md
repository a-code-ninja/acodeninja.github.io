title: quick app - .htaccess generator
---

I got fed up the other day of relying on other peoples .htaccess generators. Had a look and thought, sod it, why donâ€™t I start putting some nifty little applications together?

Here is the first one, .htaccess generator. This app is designed to do the little HTTP authentication driver login box you sometimes find when going on to a website.

Any feedback would be great so let me know if / what you use it for.
